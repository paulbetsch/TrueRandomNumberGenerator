# TRNG (True Random Number Generator)

## About
This repository includes all scripts and files which we use to develop a True Random Number Generator. 

## Code Style
- Always comment your code with a short explanation of what it does.
- Make sure that at least one team member understand your comments.
- Global variables should be written in upper case with underlines instead of spaces e.g TEST_VARIABLE.
- Local variables should be written in camelCase.
- Function names should be written in PascalCase except the main function which is called: `__main__()`.
- If possible divide your code into multiple python files.
- The code should always work without any external Data, but sometimes you have to use external Files than you have to write into a README.md file, which Data is required to run the code.
